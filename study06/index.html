                If there’s one thing I’ve learned about working with Marvel, they don’t leave stones unturned. They
                really don’t.

              Oh boy, we have so many questions. Perhaps the most hotly debated Endgame plot point is the fate of
              Captain America, who travels back in time to live out his life with Peggy Carter. It is established that
              Peggy had a husband and two kids, and some fans have theorized that Steve Rogers secretly was this husband
              all along. Others have stated that Steve created an alternate timeline when he went back to live with
              Peggy, and
            </p>
            <p>
              somehow got back to the mainline MCU as an old man. In conclusion, we are unsure. All we know is that the
              shield has been passed onto the Falcon (but he will not take on the name like in the comics, as the name
              of a new Disney+ show is The Falcon and the Winter Soldier) and Chris Evans is done with the MCU. So maybe
              we won't have to say goodbye to Captain America, but we'll unfortunately have to bid farewell to our
              favorite Chris.
